# Student-scores-and-study-analysis-prediction

This project is a supervised machine learning algortihm which predicts the scores of the students based on their hours of study. This requires Python and Scikit to implement regression.
We also use linear regression to predict the changes in the value of our data. In this regression task we predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.
